        <h2>Light rail</h2>
        <p>To go to city center or to school, I have to take the light rail. It takes around 30 minutes from Fantoft to city center. The light rail has big windows so I can see beautiful scenery of city Bergen. When I passing through with hearing music, I always feel like my heart is full of emotion.</p>
